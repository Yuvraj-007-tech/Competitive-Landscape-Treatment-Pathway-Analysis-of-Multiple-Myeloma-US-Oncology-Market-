🎯 Objectives of the Analysis

Map treatment pathways across transplant-eligible, transplant-ineligible, and relapsed/refractory patients

Analyze market sizing and patient segmentation

Understand the shift from triplet to quadruplet regimens

Evaluate the strategic role of monoclonal antibodies, CAR-T, bispecifics, and ADCs

Identify future value pools in advanced-line therapies

🧠 Key Strategic Insights

Multiple Myeloma is managed as a long-term chronic disease with repeated relapses

Early depth of response and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) define long first remissions

Frontline therapy is shifting from triplets → quadruplets, driven by anti-CD38 antibodies

Relapsed/Refractory value creation is moving toward CAR-T and bispecific antibodies

Advanced immunotherapies command very high per-patient value despite smaller populations
